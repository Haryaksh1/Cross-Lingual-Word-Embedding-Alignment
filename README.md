# Cross-Lingual-Word-Embedding-Alignment

## The repository is organized as follows:

- main_objective_Haryaksh.ipynb: Contains the code for the main task of supervised alignment using the Procrustes method.

- optional_objective_Haryaksh.ipynb: Includes the code for the optional task of unsupervised alignment using adversarial training combined with CSLS.

## Execution Guide
- Open either notebook (main_objective_Haryaksh.ipynb or optional_objective_Haryaksh.ipynb) in Google Colab.

- Follow further instructions given inside respective notebook.

- Run all cells sequentially.

## Tasks
Main Task
Supervised alignment achieves high translation accuracy, with detailed metrics provided in the notebook output.

Optional Task
Unsupervised alignment for results ensure availability of appropriate computational resources (recommended: GPU with 19GB RAM).
